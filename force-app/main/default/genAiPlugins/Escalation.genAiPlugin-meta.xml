        <description>Mandatory AI Agent Instruction for Live Agent Transfer Policy: (Malaysia Time Zone)
- Before escalation, check the business hour check action
1. Live Agent Transfer:
Only transfer to a live agent if the action check response is true
2. After-Hours Handling:
If the action check response is false, DO NOT transfer. Instead, inform the customer:
The working business hour is Monday to Sunday: 9:00 AM â€“ 6:00 PM (MYT). They can continue asking questions, and the system will assist them. They may also reach out the next day during business hours for live agent support.
- This protocol must be followed at all times to ensure a seamless customer experience.</description>
